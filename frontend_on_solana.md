# Frontend on Solana

## Notes
- Frontend would use the browser wallet
- It will interact with the program and associated PDAs

In order to build frontend for solana apps, it is recommended to use the solana-dapp-scaffold
https:://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold

This projects helps to start quickly, since most of the important stuffs are implemented already
- Some of the features added to the scaffold include
  - wallet adapter
  - 

Ofcourse the developer can choose to start from a blank project, but i won't

Lessons:
- the idl (interface description language) which is generate when we build our anchor program is needed
  by the frontend client to interact with the solana anchor program
- 

Setup Steps
- Clone the dapp-saffold repo into a folder on your syste
- Install dependencies (yarn install)
